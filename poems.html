                Here on this night, where the vastness of the sky <br>
                Is filled with nothing but a constellation of stars<br>
                A sight to be awestruck by<br>
                Oh, I wish I could stay in this moment forever<br>
                I’m confused about whether this is a dream or reality<br>
                Just lying here, gazing at the beauty of the stars<br>
                Holding you in my arms<br>
                While you listen to the melody my heart plays in your presence<br>
                Hearing the waves hitting the shores<br>
                The concept of time ceases to exist<br>
                And in this moment, where I feel nothing but serenity and joy<br>

                Like a shooting star<br>
                That captures both my attention and heart<br>
                Just seeing how your brown eyes sparkle in the moonlight<br>
                Oh, oh, how your beauty just glows<br>
                Leaving me starstruck<br>
                A moment where time<br>
                Ceases to flow<br>
                It's just you and me<br>

                As golden as sunlit honey<br>
                Like an golden heaven<br>

                Just holding your hands<br>
                Watching the sun set<br>

                Her nature can be so chaotic, but<br>
                There’s beauty in the chaos<br>
                A moment where<br>
                The scenery captivates<br>
