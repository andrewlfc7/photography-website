About

Hello, I'm Andrew, the eye behind the lens. To me, photography is more than just images; it's a form of Memento Mori, a concept deeply rooted in ancient Greek philosophy. "Remember that you will die," they said, a stark reminder of our mortality. Through my work, I endeavor to immortalize moments, to capture the essence of how I perceive the world. In doing so, I hope that these photographs will persist long after I've become a distant memory. This, for me, is the essence of art.

I draw inspiration from the Greeks, finding resonance in their wisdom. This perspective infuses my photography with a unique depth, a reminder that every click of the shutter is a testament to the impermanence of life. It's a bet, a roll of the dice; will I succeed or fail? The beauty lies in not knowing, in embracing the uncertainty.

So, welcome to my visual journey. Let the dice roll, and let's discover the beauty together.

Hello, I'm Andrew, the eye behind the lens. To me, photography transcends mere images; it embodies the essence of Memento Mori, a concept deeply rooted in ancient Greek philosophy. Memento Mori translates to "Remember that you will die" or simply "Remember death." I link this profound philosophy to my photography, as each captured moment serves as a timeless echo of how I perceive the world. These images stand as a stark reminder of our mortality, persisting long after I've become a distant memory. This, to me, is the heart of art.

Drawing inspiration from the wisdom of the Greeks, I infuse my photography with a unique depth, emphasizing the impermanence of life with every click of the shutter. It's a gamble, a roll of the dice; success or failure, the beauty lies in embracing the uncertainty.

Presently, I'm captivated by the beauty in both extraordinary and everyday life. While my interests may evolve over time, I'm eager to witness the progression of my body of work and share it with you. So, welcome to my visual journey. Let's roll the dice and explore the beauty together.

Andrew
